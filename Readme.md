Development is done in the following manner:
- VSCode on WSL/Windows10 for programming
- webpack & npm work on Windows10 - This is because of some inconsistencies with my Node installation on my WSL that rendered my development unbearable.

We are using some Node plugins such as CSS Less.

In order to prepare this project on a clean installation, you first need to install these plugins:
```
cd $Project-Root
npm install
```
